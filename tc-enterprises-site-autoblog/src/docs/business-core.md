# Business Core (Ground Truth)

**Mission**  
Provide laser‑engrave–ready, line‑only vector artwork with fast turnaround, plus selective custom software that reduces chaos for engraving operations.

**Origin Story**  
Started to get more hours while working as an engraver; turned into a dedicated service business (since 2012).

**Vision (3–5 years)**  
Continue the core vectorizing service while expanding into software development (SaaS) so the business can stand alone and not require working for anyone else.

**Core Values**  
- Honesty  
- Reliability  
- Competitive pricing

**Differentiators**  
- High‑quality, hand‑drawn vectors tailored for laser engraving  
- < 24‑hour turnaround for the current customer  
- Flat rate for artwork (legacy commitment: “no limits” on scope for current client)  
- Ability to deliver custom software solutions (AI real estate assistant MVP, Cutco sales‑rep portal, logo/catalog system)

**Customers**  
- **Current**: Branding Tools Inc. (engraving arm of Cutco Closing Gifts; ~600 sales reps). Primary contact: Tony Carlston (owner).  
- **Ideal/Future**: Any company or individual needing engrave‑ready logos or related software — provided invoices are paid.

**Positioning (Short)**  
*“Engrave‑ready vectors in under 24 hours, plus practical software that streamlines your workflow workflow.”*
