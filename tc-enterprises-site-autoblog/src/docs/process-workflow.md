# Process & Workflow (Current State)

## Intake
- Source: Email, Mon–Fri.  
- Log each request in the weekly Excel “Logo Log” and create a matching job folder.

## Foldering & Naming
- Weekly root folder (e.g., `09.22.25 through 09.26.25 (#0796)`).
- Job folder: `LastName #OrderNumber` (e.g., `Hickman #73095217`).  
- Maintain subfolders: `01-Complete`, `02-Not Done`, `03-PLT Conversions`, `04-HOLD`, plus ad‑hoc client/job folders.

## Duplicate Check
- Search backed‑up completed files before starting.  
- If duplicate exists: reply with details so they can find it on their server; service not needed.

## Artwork Production
1. Open source art in Adobe Illustrator.  
2. If quality is good: create traced copy of line‑work only.  
3. If poor quality: attempt to find a better image (Google).  
4. If none found: request better art or route to alternate provider.  
5. Save **AI** master (two layers, everything needed to modify).  
6. Export **EPS** with only line‑art layer (no fills).

**File Naming**: `LastName #OrderNumber -- Company Name` for AI and EPS.

## Delivery
- Email completed engrave‑ready EPS to the required address.

## QA
- Visual QA before sending (acknowledged room for error). If a mistake is discovered, fix quickly at no charge.

## Throughput Context
- ~1,500–2,000 logos/year (mostly from a single customer).  
- Turnaround target: < 24 hours for current client.

## Future Improvements
- Formalize tiered pricing and rush fees for new clients.  
- Add checklist‑based QA.  
- Automate duplicate detection + weekly log population.
