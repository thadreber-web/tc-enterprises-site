# Services Catalog (Internal Truth)

## A. Engrave‑Ready Artwork
**Description**: Laser‑engrave–ready, line‑only vector artwork. PLT/HPGL and other formats on request.  
**Deliverables**: EPS by email. (AI master retained internally unless requested.)  
**Scope Rules**: Legacy client has “no limits” by prior arrangement. For new clients define: concepts/revisions, acceptable source quality, redraw thresholds.  
**Pricing**: OK to publish. (Current internal anchor: *confirm legacy $25; use tiered pricing for new clients*.)  
**Rush/Tiers**: Add for new clients (see *Pricing & Tiers*).

## B. Legacy File Cleanup
Normalize existing EPS/other vectors to engraving‑safe line‑only output; remove fills; ensure consistent results.  
**Deliverables**: Cleaned EPS. Optional summary report.  
**Pricing**: “Starting at”; volume discounts preferred.

## C. Specialized Software Development (SaaS)
Bespoke tools for engraving operations and adjacent workflows (AI assistant for real estate, sales‑rep portal, artwork catalog).  
**Delivery & Support**: Install & setup included. Solo operation → limited free support window (e.g., 30 days).  Additional support available upon request, for a fee.
**Pricing**: “Starting at” figures + encourage subscription.

## D. Website Dev / Light IT Consulting
Practical websites and light IT to support the above.  
**Pricing**: “Starting at” (time & materials or scoped packages).

**General Notes**  
- Spell out inclusions/exclusions in quotes.  
- Add rush/SLA tiers for new customers after first multi‑client milestone.
