Juggling multiple AI assistants in a team project can feel like trying to conduct a chaotic orchestra. Conflicting edits, overwritten work, and using the wrong tool for the job can slow down innovation. But what if you could bring harmony to that chaos right inside your editor? We're excited to introduce the All-Assistants Orchestration Hub, a powerful new system designed to turn your development environment into a seamlessly coordinated powerhouse.

The Orchestration Hub integrates directly into VS Code, acting as the conductor for your AI collaborators. It prevents headaches with smart file locking, so you can say goodbye to accidentally overwriting a teammate's progress. The hub intelligently recommends the best AI model for your specific task, whether you're designing architecture, refactoring code, or writing documentation. Before you apply any changes, you can preview them with a clear "diff" view and get an automated risk assessment that flags potential issues in critical files. It's all about giving you the confidence to leverage AI without losing control.

This isn't just about avoiding problems—it's about unlocking a smarter, faster way to build. By providing guardrails and intelligent suggestions, the Orchestration Hub lets your team focus on creating amazing things with your AI partners, not managing them. It’s time to transform your development process from a noisy jam session into a perfectly synchronized symphony.
