# Client FAQ

**What do I receive with each logo order?**  
A laser-ready, stroke-only EPS plus a preview PNG. I retain the working AI file so future tweaks are fast.

**Which file types can I send?**  
PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG, AI, EPS. Higher resolution helps, but I can usually rebuild clean vectors from rough input.

**How quickly do you turn artwork?**  
Standard turnaround is one business day from the time I have usable art. Rush support is available.

**Do you offer rush service?**  
Yes. Same or next business day work adds a rush fee. Weekend or after-hours work is available by agreement.

**How do I submit a request?**  
Email the job with the last name, order number, company name, best source file, and notes such as "match prior order 12345678".

**How are files named?**  
`LastName #OrderNumber -- Company Name` so your production team can find things quickly.

**Do you check for duplicates before billing?**  
Yes. I search existing archives first and point you to the file if I already have it.

**How will I receive the finished artwork?**  
I email the engraving-ready EPS. Shared folders or SFTP can be arranged on request.

**What happens if there is an error?**  
If I introduced the issue, I fix it at no charge within three business days. Changes after approval are quoted as new work.

**Can you work with diamond-drag or other formats?**  
Yes. I can deliver PLT/HPGL and other machine formats; just tell me your setup.

**Can you clean or normalize old EPS files?**  
Yes. Legacy cleanup removes fills, normalizes strokes, and makes sure geometry engraves cleanly.

**Do you build software or automation tools?**  
Yes. I scope automation, catalog, and chatbot projects with starting price anchors, then finalize the quote once we review your workflow. Expect a quick "it depends" followed by a clear plan and milestones.

**When are you available and how do payments work?**  
I operate Monday through Friday (Pacific). Invoices are Net 15. Projects above $1,000 may require a 50% deposit. Rush or after-hours work is billed with the corresponding premium.

**What if my question is not listed here?**  
Ask the assistant. If the answer is not documented, it will offer to connect you with a human on Discord or open a contact form.

**How do I speak with someone directly?**  
Email [contact@tc-enterprises.com](mailto:contact@tc-enterprises.com) or join the Discord support channel: https://discord.com/channels/1420218161319645186/1420218161986408500. We reply within one business day during MondayFriday, Pacific Time.
