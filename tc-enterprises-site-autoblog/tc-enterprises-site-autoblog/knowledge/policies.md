# Policies

## Intellectual Property
You’re responsible for having the rights to the logos/art you send. I may refuse work that seems unauthorized or inappropriate.

## Privacy & Data
I treat your files confidentially and minimize what I store. The site bot avoids sharing personal info and redacts sensitive details in transcripts.

## Revisions & Refunds
One minor tweak (typo/spacing) is included. Larger changes or alternate versions may require a new quote. Because this is custom work, refunds are uncommon; if something’s off, I’ll work with you to make it right.

## Content I Decline
Hate, harassment, or otherwise unlawful content will be declined.

## Turnaround
I communicate realistic timing. Rush may be available—ask first.
