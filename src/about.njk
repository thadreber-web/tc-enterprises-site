<h1>About T & C Enterprises</h1>
<p>I started by digitizing logos for a high‑volume engraver. The old process took weeks. I rebuilt it: switched from diamond drag to laser, standardized on EPS, and tuned the pipeline for speed and repeatability.</p>
<p>Today I run production‑grade engraving support alongside software that keeps reps moving—catalogs, automation, and lightweight AI where it helps.</p>
<p>Every logo is prepared for engraving: stroke‑only, clean paths, and predictable filenames so downstream machines behave exactly as expected.</p>
