<h1>About T &amp; C Enterprises</h1>

<p>I started T &amp; C Enterprises on the production floor, solving real engraving problems. The goal was simple: deliver artwork that just works — every time — for laser engraving.</p>

<h2>From PLT to EPS, Tuned for Laser</h2>

<p>We transitioned from diamond-drag workflows (PLT/HPGL) to laser-optimized EPS. Our files are stroke-only, compound-path-safe, and cleaned for predictable output. That means fewer restarts, less material waste, and faster throughput.</p>

<h2>Built for Busy Shops</h2>

<p>If your team runs thousands of units a week, you can’t babysit artwork. We standardize naming, prep proofs, and deliver files that flow straight to production. Need a rush? We do that too.</p>

<h2>What We Believe</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Production first:</strong> Art that runs clean beats art that merely looks good.</li>
	<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Clear proofs, clear policies, clear filenames.</li>
	<li><strong>Partnership:</strong> We adapt to your laser, materials, and timelines.</li>
</ul>
